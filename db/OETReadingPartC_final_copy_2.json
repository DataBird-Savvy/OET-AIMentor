              "passage": "In August, an alert was issued on the safe use of opioids in hospitals. This reported the incidence of respiratory depression among post-surgical patients to an average 0.5%  thus for every 5,000 surgical patients, 25 will experience respiratory depression. Failure to recognise respiratory depression and institute timely intervention can lead to cardiopulmonary arrest, resulting in brain injury or death. A retrospective multi-centre study of 14,720 cardiopulmonary arrest cases showed that 44% were respiratory related and more than 35% occurred on the general care floor. It is therefore recommended that post-operative patients now have continuous monitoring, instead of spot checks, of both oxygenation and ventilation.",
