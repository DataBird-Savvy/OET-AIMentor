    "Scenario": "A patient is visiting a nurse to discuss their recent health concerns and get advice on managing their condition.",
    "Passage_type": "Part A",
    "Listening_Passage": "Nurse: Good morning, Mr. Smith. How can I assist you today?  Patient: Good morning, Nurse. I've been feeling quite fatigued lately and I’m not sure why. Nurse: I see. Fatigue can be caused by various factors. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this fatigue? Patient: It’s been about three weeks now. I'm also having trouble sleeping. Nurse: That could be related. Have there been any changes in your lifestyle or stress levels? Patient: Well, I’ve been under a lot of stress at work lately, and my diet has not been great. Nurse: Stress and poor nutrition can definitely contribute to fatigue. Have you had a chance to eat regular meals? Patient: Not really. I often skip breakfast and sometimes lunch. Nurse: That's important to address. Skipping meals can lead to decreased energy levels. I recommend you start by having a balanced breakfast each morning. Patient: That sounds good, but I’m not sure what to include. Nurse: Try to include protein, whole grains, and some fruit. For example, oatmeal with nuts and a banana would be a nutritious option. Patient: I can do that. Is there anything else I should consider? Nurse: Yes, I suggest incorporating some physical activity into your routine, as exercise can improve your energy levels and help reduce stress. Patient: I usually don’t have time for that. Nurse: Even a short walk during your lunch break can make a difference. Additionally, if you’re interested, I can arrange for you to meet with a dietitian who can provide more personalized dietary advice. Patient: I would appreciate that. What about the sleep issue? Nurse: Sleep hygiene is crucial. Ensure your sleeping environment is comfortable and consider establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Avoid caffeine in the hours leading up to sleep. Patient: Great, I’ll work on that. How soon should I see improvement? Nurse: You may begin to feel better within a few weeks with these changes. However, if the fatigue persists, it might be best to undergo some tests to rule out any underlying health issues. Patient: Thank you, Nurse. I feel more hopeful now.",
