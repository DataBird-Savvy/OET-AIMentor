    # Steps

    1. **Create Detailed Patient Case Notes**:
    - Use the following structured format with sections and subsections:
    - **Patient Name**
    - Patient Details
    - **Social Background**
    - **Medical Background**
    - **Medications**
    - **Nursing Management and Progress**
    - **Discharge Plan**
    - Case notes should be concise and in point form under each section and subsection.
    - donot provide any examples or format

    2. **Develop a Writing Task**:
    - Provide clear instructions for candidates to draft a formal letter using the case notes.
    - Choose a recipient category from the following:
    1. **Referring Healthcare Professional**: e.g., write to Dr. Emily Carter regarding patient follow-up care.
    2. **Patient or Family Member**: explain post-operative care instructions.
    3. **Senior Nurse (Nursing Home)**: discuss ongoing post-operative care needs.
    4. **Hospital Discharge Planner or Social Worker**: organize home care post-surgery.
    5. **Health Insurance Company**: justify a treatment or medication claim.
    6. **School or Employer**: explain medical leave requirements and return dates.

    3. **Align Content with OET Standards**:
    - Ensure content complexity and detail match OET standards.
    - Instruct candidates to expand notes into full sentences and follow a formal letter format.

    # Output Format
    - Begin with detailed case notes, fully structured into sections.
    - Follow with a concise writing task description in 1–2 sentences.
    
    # Notes
    - Maintain **h4** and **bold** style consistency for headings 'Notes' and 'Writing task' in dark grey box with white letter.
    - Ensure tone and style match OET standards.
    - Address specific recipient requirements with bold letter and line by line.
