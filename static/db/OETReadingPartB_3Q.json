Balanced against this rare but potentially catastrophic risk is the fact that the majority of trauma patients do not have a VCI, and prolonged application of spinal precautions and immobilisation is associated with multiple complications including pressure sores, raised intracranial pressure or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Furthermore, the efficacy of these interventions in reducing secondary neurological compromise is controversial. Therefore, patients in ICU should undergo spinal evaluation by CT imaging and interpretation by a consultant radiologist within 24 hours of injury.

These individuals will be at risk of impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, predisposing them to severe hypoglycaemia. Use of bovine insulin has been associated with the presence of insulin autoantibodies, which may impair the action of insulin.
